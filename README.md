# JukeBerry

JukeBerry is an application for streaming music from devices to a RaspberryPI.

## Introduction

I wanted a self-made hackable solution for streaming music to an analog
amplifier, which was available for any guests in the home to connect to. Using
cheap and available Raspberry PI devices (I'm going to target the "Zero W"
board), it should act as either a headless, or a GUI presenting solution. This
allows for a cheap self-contained small solution to streaming audio.

Eventually I've thought of maybe supporting video for casting for connecting to
a TV that might not have all the "smart" features.

## Roadmap

- ❌ Spotify Connect
- ❌ iOS AirPlay
- ❌ Bluetooth connection

### Hopeful Future Features

- ❌ Self-hosted Web Server
- ❌ Distributed Web Control via QR Code
- ❌ Video Streaming
  - ❌ iOS AirPlay screen casting
  - ❌ Android screen casting
  - ❌ Windows screen casting
